# Egress Proxy security model

This companion describes the proposed security contract for
[RFC-0019](index.md). It is for reviewers assessing authorization, credential
custody and failure boundaries. It does not establish an implemented or
qualified system. [Lifecycle](lifecycle.md) owns preparation, rotation, startup
and recovery. [Management](control-contracts.md) and [runtime contracts](runtime-contracts.md)
define proposed transport-neutral fields and method results, not implemented APIs.

## Assets and threat model

The design protects provider credentials and refresh inputs; admitted sources,
routes and grants; Agent and caller identities; provider operations and their
responses; and workspace data preserved during parking or a fork. An Agent can
be compromised, issue malicious requests, or try to obtain provider material.
A Secret writer can change values used by admitted consumers. A provider, store
or network can fail, return unexpected content, or leave an effect uncertain.

The trust boundary is between Agent workloads and trusted senders, resolvers,
lifecycle owners, Secret Drivers and OCC. Trusted components and their
configuration need their own protection and isolation. A resolver handle
guards mistakes among trusted callers; it does not defend against hostile code
in the same process. A route constrains mediated use, but cannot narrow the
authority of a bearer stolen from a trusted component or provider.

| Abuse or failure                                                     | Proposed boundary                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| An Agent tries to steal credentials or bypass its grant.             | Enforce egress and keep material and handles outside the workload. OCC checks each operation against current authority. |
| A caller substitutes an operation, route or material after approval. | Bind the final check to the actual immutable operation and selected material identity and version.                      |
| A shared source or warm token is used across the wrong scope.        | Authorize each Agent; partition resolver reuse by admitted source generation, normalized grant and isolation boundary.  |
| A provider returns a credential in a response.                       | Apply provider-specific response policy; redact or refuse forms that cannot be handled safely.                          |
| A refresh, send or clone has an unknown outcome.                     | Retain the attempt and reconcile the effect or reauthorize; do not blindly replay it.                                   |
| An owner loses access or a workspace is copied.                      | Hold and park on confirmed last-owner loss; a deep fork receives a fresh stopped identity and no inherited authority.   |

These boundaries depend on qualified enforcement and custody. Source inspection
or fixture behavior alone cannot prove them.

## Callers and trust boundaries

OCC admits source, binding, backend, provider, route and grant configuration.
The trusted sender derives caller context from an authenticated boundary, not
from the request's assertions. An Agent has a stable Namespace-scoped
ServicePrincipal and a separate bearer for an individual execution. Each Agent
must be authorized to use a binding, even when the source is shared.

### Agent and bootstrap

Trusted bootstrap is a separate caller with authenticated delegation limited to
the execution and configured repository. It need not traverse the Agent's proxy.
Its request-path resolution is warm-only, and its delegation does not grant
management preparation. Its clone and cleanup duties are in
[repository preparation](lifecycle.md#2-prepare-the-optional-repository).

### Management preparation

Control-plane configuration and discovery use a separate authenticated caller.
Its authority is limited to the exact Installation and Namespace, source,
purpose, operation, scope and destination, plus applicable initiating-user and
saved-binding rights. When explicitly authorized, it may ask the designated
lifecycle owner to prepare or refresh material. The management caller submits the business operation through the trusted
Forwarder and receives a sanitized response. Any material-consuming callback is
internal to the designated trusted sender or custody implementation, never an
arbitrary caller function or a bypass of these checks. OCC checks current
authority before material access and again after preparation, before each
provider send. The lifecycle owner retains authority checks for issuer operations.

### Retrieval and recovery

Retrieval supplies usable runtime material only to authorized trusted code. It
exports no signing or refresh roots and starts no second refresher. Provisioning
roots to the lifecycle owner is a separate authorized operation. Provider tokens
and handles do not go to the Agent or UI; results are sanitized.

Management authority comes from the authenticated control-plane boundary and
admitted purpose, never an Agent-selected flag or request field. It does not
relax the warm-only request-path Resolver. Record a secret-free audit of caller,
initiating principal, source and grant, destination, purpose and outcome. Denial,
withdrawal, unavailable authority, failed preparation or material still unusable
within the original deadline refuses use. A failed or cancelled retrieval does
not prove that refresh had no effect; retain uncertain attempts without blind
replay. [Management retrieval](lifecycle.md#management-preparation-and-retrieval)
describes the source integration and its limits.

## Authorize each operation

For every supported operation, including credential-free egress, the trusted
sender authenticates the caller and captures an immutable description of the
operation, including its destination, protocol authority and policy-relevant
content. Sealed streams expose policy-relevant semantics to OCC and enforce a
registered grammar and finite bounds; a digest alone cannot support inspection.
No whole unbounded body needs to be buffered. It selects an admitted route and grant; a credentialed operation also
needs a binding. Before material access, OCC checks current authority online over
the authenticated caller, versioned route, grant and captured operation.
Unavailable authority, ambiguous routes,
unsupported operations and insufficient scope are refused. Provider adapters
classify operations against normalized grants, including repository ID and
action for GitHub. Requests cannot select another source or backend, load a
driver or widen scope.

After resolution, or when no material is needed, OCC freshly checks the actual
immutable operation, authenticated caller, versioned route and grant, and the
selected material's nonsecret identity and version, or explicit absence of
material. Policy receives no credential bytes; a send cannot substitute another
operation or material after the check. Changed routes or grants require
re-admission and repeated checks. Cached allows cannot substitute for either
check, even with cached material.

Both checks remain fresh online evaluations. Transport encoding may vary, but
cannot remove a check or reuse a cached allow. This grants no atomic-revocation
exception.

For each HTTP subrequest, redirect, retry or new operation on a reused
connection:

1. Repeat both checks and any required resolution.
2. Recheck material usability and send once.
3. Enforce a finite, short send-start deadline and the original absolute
   operation deadline. Retries cannot extend the latter.

Deadline values, time protocol and transport enforcement remain open.

## Resolution and custody

The request-path Resolver serves static and dynamic material through one
contract. It accepts an admitted binding and operation context and returns a
use-bound, single-use handle to trusted code, or `Denied`, `NotReady` or
`Unavailable`. A handle conveys no authority to send. Material version can
change independently of configuration generation. The implementation must
provide nonsecret identity, version and expiry evidence for the final check and
dispatch. [MaterialEvidence and handle validation](runtime-contracts.md#two-policy-checks-and-common-resolution)
define required fields and associations; physical transport remains to be qualified.

### Dynamic reuse

Dynamic token reuse is confined behind the Resolver by source generation,
normalized grant and isolation boundary. A narrower grant cannot borrow a
broader token. Every credentialed Agent or bootstrap operation resolves again.
There is no dynamic token push, reusable proxy-side cache or fallback, and static
stale grace does not apply. A healthy Resolver may serve eligible unexpired
material during an issuer outage; Resolver failure refuses use. For Agent and
bootstrap requests, cold or expired dynamic material yields `NotReady` without
request-time issuance, signing, refresh or scheduling. Separately authorized
management preparation does not change that lookup contract or permit proxy
fallback. Authenticated rejection feedback can prompt background recovery through
the lifecycle owner; it does not make lookup schedule refresh or permit an
automatic sender retry. See [withdrawal and recovery](lifecycle.md#4-withdraw-and-recover).

### Custody

Source policy must permit material at the trusted sender, and its implementation
must qualify that custody. Registering a refresh source does not itself authorize
delivery of signing or refresh inputs to the Egress Proxy or other
consumers; those inputs remain confined to the roles that need them under the
admitted custody policy. Keep provider credentials and resolver handles out of
Agent workloads, files and diagnostics; strip Agent authentication before
forwarding. Static freshness and typed failures are specified in
[live Secret cutover](lifecycle.md#live-secret-cutover); rotating input custody,
fencing and durable replacement are specified in
[withdrawal and recovery](lifecycle.md#4-withdraw-and-recover).

Admitted custody policy and runtime qualification are RFC requirements. The
inspected #1749 source head `1c6ac12f` separates refresh inputs from Gateway registration, while
#4357 permits operator retrieval of selected runtime credentials. Those code
boundaries do not establish a general custody-policy mechanism or authorize
export to Agents; see [implementation evidence](lifecycle.md#implementation-discovery-and-qualification).

## Protect responses

A trusted provider-specific policy covers successes, errors and streams,
including headers, bodies, trailers and encodings.

| Result                       | Treatment                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safe content                 | Pass the permitted response to the Agent.                                                                                                                              |
| Content requiring protection | Redact or refuse it; unsafe forms cannot pass unchecked. The Agent receives a permitted response or placeholder, not provider material.                                |
| Provider rejection           | Retain a policy-processed `SafeResponse` and typed exact-version feedback. Preserve the failure where safe; redact or refuse as configured. Never retry automatically. |

A blocked response, provider rejection or local timeout after dispatch does not
establish that the provider performed no action. Distinguish refusal before
send from a known response and a possible dispatch. Preserve uncertain attempts
for the [recovery owner](lifecycle.md#4-withdraw-and-recover).

## Protocol and bypass boundaries

Prevent unmediated Agent egress and bind the destination and protocol authority
to the authorized operation.

| Traffic or failure                     | Required boundary                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opaque SSH, database and other traffic | Deny without individually authorizable operations.                |
| UDP and QUIC                           | Prevent bypass of enforcement.                                    |
| Additional protocols                   | Require explicit operation boundaries and evidence.               |
| Enforcement or dependency failure      | Hardened deployments must not silently fall back to no-op egress. |

## Withdrawal and owner loss

A check observing a committed reduction or hold denies removed access. The
Egress Proxy MVP accepts a race: a send may start after a reduction is
acknowledged if its final check raced that change. Finite in-flight work may
continue until the original deadline. Cancellation is best effort; a timeout
neither proves remote cancellation nor undoes an effect. Ordered admission and
renewable stream leases are follow-up work, not guarantees of this proposal.
Scope expansion waits for required warm material and a fresh check; narrower
access may continue.

When an operator disables or removes an owner in OCE, confirmed loss of the last
authorized owner installs a hold and fence for new admissions, subject to the
race above. A team Agent with remaining owners does not park solely because one
leaves. Unknown owner or directory state is not confirmed loss. Report incomplete
containment and `parking` until stop and preservation evidence supports `parked`.

Deployment, restart, repair, deletion and garbage collection cannot bypass the
hold or remove protected data. Platform-owned cleanup continues for the exact
accepted work even if its requester loses access. Release requires current
authorization and fresh execution admission. External identity-provider
offboarding synchronization is later work.

## Authorized forks

An authorized reader can fork the declared readable artifact set from an
immutable captured version. Recheck source-read and destination-create
authority before visibility. The deep copy has independent application data and
mutable references, a fresh stopped identity and runtime home, and no inherited
credentials, grants, approvals or sessions. Copied schedules, hooks and pending
work remain inert until admitted. The original remains available for authorized
read-only review. Copy-on-write and deeper incident preservation require
separate designs.

## Accepted limits and open questions

The check-to-send race and best-effort cancellation are accepted limits. These
integration choices remain open:

| Choice                                      | Evidence or constraint                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First sender/custody transport              | Qualify execution bearer issuance, delivery and lifetime, bootstrap delegation and management identity. Identity fields and audiences are specified. |
| GitHub lifecycle owner and issuer transport | Select one owner; preserve grant, attempt, material and expiry evidence.                                                                             |
| First provider/operation slice              | Qualify DNS enforcement and Codex WebSocket boundaries or an HTTP/SSE path.                                                                          |

Engineering must choose concrete deadlines, clocks and alert thresholds within
these contracts. External authorization integration, identity exchange, horizontal
HA and proxy fallback need separate work. These choices do not weaken either
check, the custody boundary or fail-closed behavior.

## Required validation

A hardened Egress Proxy MVP must qualify its declared provider slice with actual
enforcement. Evidence must cover caller and tenant isolation; scope and grant
checks; withdrawal and partitions; protocol bypass; safe response handling;
cache and renewal bounds; bounded startup; and uncertain cleanup. Any slice
using rotating inputs must prove concurrency fencing, durable replacement,
restart and uncertain-effect recovery. OCE 1.0 must qualify the full static
inference, GitHub preclone, Codex OAuth and custom dynamic paths.

Migration proof must also exercise stale commands, conflicting request IDs,
forged attachments/receipts, catalog removal cleanup, late attachment after
withdrawal, family-wide rotating locks across distinct grants, and rejection of
N after N+1. Confirm every legacy consumer has moved before removing old exports
and persistence coupling.

Check profile capabilities at startup and Agent admission against qualification
evidence for the exact implementation versions, configuration, provider/protocol
slice and custody. Self-declared capabilities are insufficient. Minimal CI and
fixture/no-op adapters cannot prove enforcement or injection; deployment
acceptance alone does not prove material or Agent readiness. Keep source,
fixture, installed-runtime and live-provider evidence distinct. The
[qualification plan](lifecycle.md#implementation-discovery-and-qualification)
describes remaining integration and proof work.
