# Proposed capture, resolution and forwarding contracts

These internal interfaces are proposed transport-neutral IDL. They do not add
registered Drivers, services or an Agent token API. Closed records and common
identities are defined in [management contracts](control-contracts.md#identities-and-admission).
Runtime authentication must enforce every handle association; a TypeScript brand
alone is insufficient. Physical OpenShell transport remains to be qualified.

## Capture and trusted handles

`EgressForwarder.capture(peer: Peer, exchange: Exchange, bounds: Bounds)` returns
`captured(operation: OperationHandle)` or `Refusal`. Only the trusted transport
can construct Peer and Exchange. The sender authenticates credentials and
derives the following Caller from current OCC execution/delegation records;
workload JSON cannot supply these identities.

| Shape             | Required fields/variants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Caller`          | `agent`: Execution; `bootstrap`: Execution plus executorId, delegationId, repositoryId; `management`: Scope plus servicePrincipalId, initiatingPrincipalId, purpose (`configuration\|discovery`), authorizationId. All identifiers are immutable Ids.                                                                                                                                  |
| `Peer`            | Authenticated channel handle, trusted sender Ref, identity evidence handle; both handles are issued by the transport verifier and bound to its audience, expiry and anti-replay state.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Exchange`        | Transport-owned immutable request plus response sink, connection evidence and absolute deadline. No caller-provided function may receive material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Request`         | `method: HTTP method`, canonical HTTPS URL, ordered header name/value pairs, body representation below, connection `{address: IP, port: integer, tlsName: string, httpAuthority: string}`.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Body`            | `bounded`: sealed bytes and size limit; `stream`: sealed reader, registered operation-policy Ref, finite byte limit and grammar state. Both expose policy-relevant fields to OCC before dispatch; digest alone is insufficient.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Use`             | `{id: Id, caller: Caller, route: Route, request: Request, classification: Classification, capturedAt: UTC timestamp, deadlineAt: UTC timestamp}`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Classification`  | Initial closed schemas: inference `generate{model: string}` or `list_models{}`; GitHub `repository{repositoryId: Id, action: clone\|read\|write}` or `list_repositories{installationId: Id}`; OAuth/API `{operationPolicy: Ref, action: string}` validated against that versioned policy's closed action list. Extensions use the registered provider schema, never arbitrary context. |
| `OperationHandle` | Opaque runtime reference to sealed Use and response sink, bound to peer/sender and deadline; single-use dispatch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Discovery operations use separately admitted policy and applicable management
authority. Listing models or repositories requires no invented model/repository
ID and cannot borrow broader authority from an Agent binding.

Capture resolves the unique admitted Route and freezes the provider operation
after permitted noncredential transformations. Streaming support pins all
policy-relevant semantics and enforces the admitted grammar without buffering an
unbounded body. A later frame that needs another decision is another operation;
unsupported/opaque streams are refused. Runtime material injection cannot change
the authorized operation. Changed content requires new capture and checks.

## Two policy checks and common resolution

| Method                               | Input                                                                                                                                                     | Result and caller                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EgressAuthorizer.check`             | `{phase: before_access, operation: OperationHandle}` or `{phase: before_send, operation: OperationHandle, material: MaterialEvidence\|none}`, plus Bounds | Trusted Forwarder calls OCC. `allow(permit: AccessPermit\|SendPermit)` for the corresponding phase, or Refusal.                                                                                        |
| `CredentialResolver.resolve`         | `{operation: OperationHandle, access: AccessPermit, maxStaticAgeMs: nonnegative integer, minRemainingValidityMs: nonnegative integer}`, plus Bounds       | Forwarder only; `ready(material: MaterialHandle, evidence: MaterialEvidence)` or Refusal. Limits can tighten admitted policy, never widen it. No issuer/provider call, signing, refresh or scheduling. |
| `CredentialResolver.reportRejection` | `RejectionFeedback`, plus Bounds                                                                                                                          | Trusted response classifier only; `recorded`, `obsolete` or Refusal. Invalidates only the exact version and separately informs its lifecycle owner.                                                    |
| `EgressForwarder.forward`            | OperationHandle                                                                                                                                           | `ForwardOutcome` below; owns the complete sequence, not an injection callback. Uses capture's original Bounds.                                                                                         |

OCC dereferences the runtime-verified handle to inspect the exact Use. Each check
evaluates current IAM rights and applicable initiating-user rights, execution or
delegation currency, hold/withdrawal state, source/binding/backend/provider/route
generations, normalized grant and actual classified operation. For selected dynamic
material, check its current family generation and owner epoch as well. This extends OCC
policy evaluation; generic IAM principal/action/resource input alone is
insufficient. Checks include credential-free operations and cache hits. No
cached allow substitutes for either fresh online evaluation.

`AccessPermit` is a Permit restricted to this Use, source and resolver, expiring
within its deadline; it authorizes one resolution, never a send. `SendPermit`
additionally binds selected material identity/version or explicit `none`, sender,
and a short finite `sendStartBy` timestamp. Neither is renewable authority.

`MaterialEvidence` contains SourceKey, binding Ref, grantHash, isolationId,
materialId, materialVersion, usableUntil, and exactly one variant:

| Kind      | Additional required evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `static`  | SecretRef, authoritativeObservedAt, `retention: none\|bounded`, `freshness: fresh\|eligible_stale`; bounded usableUntil respects source total-age, positive request age limit and any Secret expiry. `none` is fresh authoritative material confined to this request's deadline, applicable positive age bounds and Secret expiry. |
| `dynamic` | familyId, familyGeneration (positive integer), owner Ref, ownerEpoch (positive integer), preparationAttemptId, actual normalized Grant, providerExpiresAt; usableUntil never exceeds expiry.                                                                                                                                       |

`MaterialHandle` binds evidence to this Use, AccessPermit, permitted sender and
deadline. It is single-use and consumed inside trusted injection only. Internal
or remote handles need runtime registries or authenticated audience/expiry/replay
validation. No handle or usable bytes reach an Agent, UI, arbitrary callback,
diagnostic or log. Material is not authority.

Dynamic reuse is behind the Resolver, keyed by the exact
[WarmKey](lifecycle.md#lifecycle-interface), including admitted scope. Every
credentialed operation resolves again. A narrower grant cannot borrow a broader
token. An issuer outage may coexist with valid committed material; Resolver
failure has no proxy cache fallback. Credential-free use skips resolve and
passes `none` to check 2.

Source cache `none` or request `maxStaticAgeMs=0` forces an authoritative read,
without reusable retention or stale fallback at any serving layer. Zero means
fresh-read semantics, not a literally zero elapsed age at send. Successfully
read material remains usable only for this original request within its deadline
and provider/Secret expiry; discard after completion/cancellation. Applicable
positive source/request age bounds still cap usability at dispatch.

### Forwarding sequence and results

The Forwarder follows this sequence:

1. Validate capture and obtain check 1.
2. Resolve material if credentialed; obtain check 2 over the unchanged Use and
   actual selected evidence.
3. Validate handle binding, material usability, send-start and original deadlines.
4. Consume handles, strip execution authentication, inject material, send once
   and protect the response.

Resolve results cannot dispatch. Management preparation occurs separately before
this sequence and never grants lasting authority.

`Refusal` is one of these closed safe variants:

| Kind                             | Codes                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `denied`                         | `identity`, `unauthorized`, `withdrawn`, `stale_configuration`, `scope_mismatch`, `ambiguous_route`, `invalid_handle`, `unsupported_operation` |
| `not_ready`                      | `cold`, `expired`, `insufficient_validity`, `material_missing`, `attachment_pending`, `recovery_required`                                      |
| `unavailable`                    | `authority`, `resolver`, `secret_store`, `lifecycle`                                                                                           |
| `cancelled`, `deadline_exceeded` | No additional fields; pre-dispatch only.                                                                                                       |

`SendReceipt` is authenticated evidence containing Use ID, sender Ref, selected
MaterialEvidence or none, attemptId, original deadline and
`dispatch: confirmed|possible`. It is retained by the sender's recovery owner;
classification cannot be supplied by the Agent.

| `ForwardOutcome`    | Required fields and meaning                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `refused`           | `dispatched: false, error: Refusal`; no send possible.                                                                                                      |
| `response`          | `receipt: SendReceipt, response: SafeResponse`; confirmed dispatch.                                                                                         |
| `provider_rejected` | `receipt: SendReceipt, response: SafeResponse, feedback: RejectionFeedback`; preserves the provider failure under response policy, with no automatic retry. |
| `response_blocked`  | receipt, `code: response_policy`; provider effect may already exist.                                                                                        |
| `uncertain`         | receipt with possible dispatch; reconcile exact attempt, never infer safe retry from timeout.                                                               |

`SafeResponse` contains status, policy-processed ordered headers, bounded bytes
or a protected stream, and policy-processed trailers. Stream completion reports
`complete|blocked|interrupted`; failures after headers cannot masquerade as
pre-send refusal. The caller receives safe response data, not internal receipts
or handles. `RejectionFeedback` is `{receipt: SendReceipt, evidence:
MaterialEvidence, classification: credential_rejected}`; it binds the selected
version and comes from the trusted classifier. Return the provider failure as-is
when policy permits; configured redaction changes SafeResponse, and refusal
produces `response_blocked`. Rejection feedback may still be recorded when the
response is blocked, without leaking its content. Redirects never inherit credentials; a new admitted operation needs
both checks within the original deadline. Nothing automatically retries after
possible dispatch. The accepted check-to-send race remains; no atomic revocation
or renewable stream lease is implied.

## Versioned Secret access

Evolve the retained `SecretDriver` with
`readCredentialInput({secret: SecretRef, authorization: Permit, retention: none|permitted}, bounds)`.
Its only callers are the Resolver for static material and the authorized
lifecycle owner/issuer for initial inputs. Existing CRUD/resolve remains; the
old value-only callback cannot supply this evidence.

| Result                                            | Required fields/meaning                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `temporary`                                       | `reason: transport\|timeout\|throttled`; positively classified eligible failure.                                                                                                                    |

| `cancelled`, `deadline_exceeded`                  | No value or fallback.                                                                                                                                                                               |

The Permit binds SecretRef, consumer, purpose (`static_read|issuer_input`) and
source generation. Source-use rights do not imply direct Secret-read permission.
Static retention initially belongs in the Resolver. The
[ten-minute/four-hour-total rules](lifecycle.md#live-secret-cutover) apply across
every serving layer: lower caches preserve original authoritative age, failed
reads never reset it, and zero disables retention/fallback. A Driver lacking
trustworthy evidence cannot advertise eligible stale support. Live values are
adopted on required reads without source update or redeployment.

## Provider semantics and issuer boundary

Trusted Backend composition registers `CredentialProviderDefinition` by provider
Ref and schemaVersion, with closed Input/Grant/Classification schemas and their
normalizers, validators, injection definitions and hooks below. The built-ins
are initial schemas, not a core-owned exhaustive provider list. Registration
produces typed admitted results for that exact schema; unknown fields/versions
fail admission. A custom provider can define additional credential forms and
GitHub permission keys without an arbitrary runtime context bag or request-time
plugin discovery. No general middleware framework or per-provider service is required.

| `normalizeInput` | Provider's closed Input → `Read<Input>` for that schema; canonicalize references/configuration and validate typed fields before admission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `normalizeGrant` | `(SourceProjection, Grant) → Read<{grant: Grant, grantHash: SHA-256}>` for that schema; reject missing/unsupported restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `classify`       | `(SourceProjection, Grant, Request) → Read<Classification>`; validate destination and policy-relevant content. Git clone uses real repository URL/ID mapping and Git HTTP semantics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `injectionPlan`  | `(Classification) → Read<InjectionPlan>`; typed result from the registered closed injection schema. Built-ins: `authorization{header: Authorization, scheme: Bearer\|Basic, username: string\|none}` and `named_header{header: registered name}` for static credentials. Custom encodings require trusted versioned definitions, qualified custody and response policy. Admitted endpoint only; replace conflicting credentials. Basic requires qualified Git transport. |
| `responsePolicy` | `(Classification) → Read<{policy: Ref, mediaTypes: string[], encodings: string[], streaming: boolean, maxBytes: positive integer}>`; policy Ref resolves to registered sanitizer/refusal behavior for status, headers, body, trailers and frame boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `validateIssued` | `(Grant, Issued) → Read<Validated>`; compare actual returned authority, provider-required baseline permissions and expiry against exact normalized grant; reject excess, missing rights or unverifiable expiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

`CredentialIssuer.issue(attempt: IssuerAttempt, bounds: Bounds)` returns
`issued(candidate: Issued)`, `not_dispatched(error: Error)`,
`rejected(code: unauthorized|invalid_grant|provider_refused)`, or
`uncertain(attemptId: Id)`. Rejected proves a known refusal, not a generic
transport failure. `inspect(attempt, bounds)` returns the same settled outcomes
or uncertain; it observes provider-supported evidence, never repeats the exchange.
`retire(candidate, cleanupPermit, bounds) → Change<Removal>` disposes exact
candidate custody and, when supported, revokes it; reports remaining obligations
rather than promising universal bearer recall.

`IssuerAttempt` contains SourceKey, exact Grant, WarmKey, familyId, owner Ref,
ownerEpoch, attemptId, original deadline and owner-authorized input handle.
That handle binds the canonical input version, issuer audience and purpose;
only the fenced owner/issuer may consume it. `Issued` contains runtime candidate
custody handle, actual Grant, providerExpiresAt, provider issuance ID (or none),
and replacement input `unchanged` or `rotated(custodyHandle, inputVersion)`.
`Validated` contains that candidate, normalized actual Grant and validated expiry.
These handles contain no public export method; roots and usable bytes remain in
trusted custody. The owner publishes [CommittedDynamic](lifecycle.md#lifecycle-interface)
only after durable commit. Resolver derives request-bound MaterialEvidence from
that evidence; the stored warm entry itself has no execution binding.

GitHub issuance signs an App JWT and requests an installation token for explicit
repository IDs/permissions; the key and JWT never become runtime candidates.
Supported OpenShell OAuth rotation uses the same attempt, replacement and
validation semantics. The logical hook is specified here; an OAuth-shaped
OpenShell bridge must still preserve grant, expiry, version and authentication
evidence. No existing hook or compatible physical transport is claimed.

## Concrete caller flows

| Caller               | Named API sequence and observable result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Static inference     | OCC `applySource` admits live SecretRef; Compute `configureRevision` → Sandbox `installEgress`. `capture` classifies inference; `forward` uses check 1 → `resolve` → `readCredentialInput`/eligible retention → check 2 → injection and safe response.                                                                                            |
| Scoped GitHub        | OCC admits repository IDs/permissions and `configureRefresh`. Owner `issue` → `validateIssued` → durable commit. Each captured GitHub operation uses `forward` → `resolve` → `readWarm`; cold returns not_ready, without preparation.                                                                                                             |
| Optional clone       | Compute observes exact attachment, `refreshStatus` and bounded required readiness; issues repository/execution delegation to bootstrap. Bootstrap uses `capture`/`forward` for every clone operation and returns [completion evidence](lifecycle.md#2-prepare-the-optional-repository). Compute owns the startup gate and cleanup.                |
| Management discovery | Trusted OCC management service authenticates caller/user and obtains exact preparation Permit before access; `prepare` → inspect/reconcile if needed → capture/forward → fresh check 1 → warm resolve → check 2 after preparation → business provider send. Return sanitized metadata. Issuer's provider calls have separate owner authorization. |

The proposed #1785 `withSourceToken` caller belongs to the last row. A callback
that consumes material is internal to the designated trusted sender or custody
implementation. The caller submits its operation through Forwarder; no caller
function may receive material or bypass capture, either check or response policy.
Neither an Agent flag nor bootstrap delegation grants management preparation.
See [security](security.md) for holds, forks and custody.
